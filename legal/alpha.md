# Alpha TOS

{% hint style="info" %}
Exclusive badges for bug testing _may_ be given. The requirements are subjective to the most useful bug reports. Therefore this would be a hard badge to get.  
Due to Alpha having lots of bugs, it would be easier to get while Alpha testing.
{% endhint %}

## **How To Report Bugs**

### **What Bugs Should I Report?**

* [ ] **Negligible** - Very minor bugs that are not worth reporting \(e.g. minor styling issues\).
* [x] **Minor** - Noticeable bugs that users may or may not notice \(e.g. emoji picker not closing\).
* [x] **Moderate** - Hard to miss bugs \(e.g. messages not updating until refresh\).
* [x] **Major** - Bugs blocking features without a workaround \(e.g. cannot change password\).

### **Where Should I Report Bugs?**

To report a bug, use the template to fill in a bug report - **linked below**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Bugs may not instantly be fixed** - fixes will be prioritised by quality of bug report, and impact of bug.
{% endhint %}

## **Alpha Guidelines**

* **Inactive accounts may be deleted without notice** - this is only for Alpha releases.

## **Alpha Disclaimer**

* **Not everything will work \(yet\)** - bugs are inevitable when humans program.
* **Native desktop support** - Native mobile support is planned, but not supported yet. 
* **25 max testers** - max members limited to minimise impact of bad programming.
* **Data is not 100% secure \(yet\)** - there is currently limited encryption and there may be exploits.
